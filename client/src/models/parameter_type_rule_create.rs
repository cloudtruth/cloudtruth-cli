/// ParameterTypeRuleCreate : A type of `ModelSerializer` that uses hyperlinked relationships with compound keys instead of primary key relationships.  Specifically:  * A 'url' field is included instead of the 'id' field. * Relationships to other instances are hyperlinks, instead of primary keys.  NOTE: this only works with DRF 3.1.0 and above.
